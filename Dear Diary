Sun 17th Sept
another day waking up from the wrong side of the bed, asking myself if i'm cut out for this path, and if i'll make it like the greats i've seen in my life, the learning curve in cloud is different and the way i've learnt i ask myself i think i know anything at the end. but tell me bestie am i really doing good?
